# FertilityRatesInMalawi
Key Insights from the data on 2015 flooding and its aftermath in southern Malawi
This report contains insights and visuals of fertility rate in Malawi data. To normalize our data, I used SQL to filter out unique rows. From the normalized data then used Data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib) python3-Anaconda to visualize and got the following insights:-
 
 
Bar charts shows the comparison between 2 identified variables(ASFR value and age group/Year).
Scatter plots shows the relationship and distribution of 2 variables (ASFR value and age group/Year).
Line graphs shows the trends of the Value to another variable

DATA VISUALIZATION OF AGE SPECIFIC FERTILITY RATES ACCORDING TO EACH YEAR OF SURVEY FROM 1992 TO 2017. 
Women age 20-24 had the highest ASFR meaning that the age group delivered more children than the other age groups.  The Value of ASFR have a continuous fall from age 25 to 49 for all survey years.
Year 2000 had the highest records of births having an ASFR value of 181.42. Years 2010 and 2012 tied with ASFR value of 163.14.
Years 2015 and 2017 there was a negative effect caused by floods. They had the lowest value of Age specific fertility rates. Year 2017 after the Malawi floods, had the lowest of 119.71. The 2015 floods had an effect on Malawi women. 
 
 

DATA VISUALIZATION FOR ASFR PER AGE GROUP.
Age group 20-24 recorded the highest value of Age specific fertility rates. They is a continuous fall thereafter as the ages of women increases.
The findings shows that for age groups 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29 recorded higher Age fertility rates in year 2000 and the rest in 1992.
In every age group, 2015 and 2017 record  the lowest value of age specific fertility rate implying that the 2015 floods may have caused a negative effects to the families and most specific women in southern Malawi.
 

   


CRUDE BIRTH RATE
Crude birth rate is a useful measure to approximate number of births when limited information is available.
 
The average CBR in Malawi is 38.3125
From 1992 the crude birth rate increase up to 2000 from where it start decreasing to all survey years. In 2017 the trend seem to stay constant.   

GENERAL FERTILITY RATE.
(Total births/totaFemales15_49)*1000
In year 1992 and 2000 the general fertility rates were higher and equal. They had the most productive Age groups.
GFR falls continuously as the years increases to 2015. In 2017, the reducing trend stops and the trend seem increasing thereafter.
    

TOTAL FERTILITY RATE 15-44
Compares fertility levels given survey years.
The TFR for age group 15-44 reduces from 1992 to 2017 due the decrease of the Age specific fertility rates.
Years 2015 and 2017 covers the poorest fertility rates although it is reducing as the years increase.
The average Total fertility rate for 15-44is 5.3.
    

TOTAL FERTILITY RATE 15-49
The TFR for age group 15-44 reduces from 1992 to 2017 due the decrease of the Age specific fertility rates.
The findings are almost similar to total fertility rate 15-44.
Average Total fertility rate 15-49 is 5.4625.
    

TOTAL WANTED FERTILITY RATE
 
The total fertility rate is higher than the Total wanted fertility rate. The values are reducing as the years increase. The total wanted fertility rate for year 2017 maybe was predicted as 3.1 otherwise.
